## Why study Information Theory?

Information Theory is a mathematical framework for thinking about what it means to have efficient communication. Examples of information include:

- Email
- Telegraph
- Images
- Speech
- Video

Much of today's digital world revolves around transmitting information: we zip files, email them across the internet, download MP3s, etc. The ideas of information theory give us a rigorous way of characterizing streams of information. The cornerstone of our model will start with the following pipeline of sorts

This model gives us a general way of abstracting the transmission of information. On the left we have a source of information (where a signal originates) that is sent to a transmitter. A channel then allows that signal to flow to a receiver, although noise may be added at this stage. Finally, the receiver sends the signal to the destination.
